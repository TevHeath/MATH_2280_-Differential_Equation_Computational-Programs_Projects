# MATH 2280: Differential Equations Problems & Simulations

##### 09/01/204 Note: This project started while I am currently a Computer Engineering Student minoring in Physic at the University of Guelph. This is a personal projects for me to develop my coding, programming and scientific computational skills as an undergraduate student. I believe that programming beyond solely the area of computer engineering and within different fields such as physics and numerical computational are an important part of my portfolio to showcase my computer engineering, computational physics, mathematical modeling, and python programming skills.

## Introduction

This respository aims at providing a sample of my abilities and a practice in the form of a improving and maintaining coding and scientific computational skills. This personal challenge is to provide a solution to the wide range of For You To Try (FYTT) exercises in the form of functions that would allow the user to input values or utilize the functions for practical simulations. If you are a physics or engineering student after I completed the course  use my code as reference or for guidance please make sure you cite this resource, don't be the person that is caught plagiarizing! This is a free & public resource on my github, so if you can find it, chances are your professor and instructors can too! Good luck with your studies :)

With my solutions I strive to supply an example of my ability in the following areas:

- problem-solving 
- translation of physics concepts to code
- electrical & computer engineering
- scientific computation
- object-oriented design
- mastery of python 
- data visualization
- 3D graphics
- computational modelling

The original questions can be found within the respository called the FYTT, these exercise are standard question that range from easy to advanced. Although depending one the question they might not require a computational solution.

## General Synopsis

Each of these programs and code can be accessed in their own folder, with corresponding documentation as needed or required within the project or computational ask from the instrcutors.


### Electricity & Magnestism Project #1: Due Date - September 19, 2024

### Electricity & Magnestism Project #2: Due Date - October 17, 2024

### Electricity & Magnestism Project #2: Due Date - November 14, 2024


Chapter 10 is not contain within the course, but this is the development of a personal projects as a Computer Engineering Student at the University of Guelph. I aimed at applying the field of differential equations with Electrical circuits and physics. I designed my own projects and applied these topics in areas that could serve to be useful int he future for potential employers and researchers.
